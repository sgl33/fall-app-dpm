#  DPM Fall Risk Detection App

Last updated: Apr. 16, 2023

## Overview

Our focus is monitoring and mitigating distress and fall risk using wearable sensors and mobile sensors on daily walking trips and construction sites. This iOS application will be able to collect multi-sensor data, visualize the data in the map interface, and build a pipeline to operate a machine-learning algorithm or route recommendation algorithm.

## Technologies

This project uses Swift 5 (SwiftUI) and Firebase (Cloud Firestore). A supported Mac is required.
